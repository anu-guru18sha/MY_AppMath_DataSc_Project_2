# MY_AppMath_DataSc_Project_2
**Customer Workflow Analytics** 


The Blue Devil Market is a busy lunch spot in the Memorial Student Center on the UW Stout campus. The Blue Devil Market offers several lunch items including brick oven pizza, a made-to-order sub sandwich line, and a hot sandwich stand as well as prepackaged food and drinks. The MSC staff would like us to investigate how customers spend time in their market. In particular they would like us to explore how long queues get for the various stations in the market and the general checkout lines. Can we determine how long customers are in the market from start to finish, and can we provide any insights on checkout time versus numbers and types of items. We can provide some results as we get them and this may lead to more questions during the term.

This project will require a mix of collecting data, statistical modeling, and simulation. Since we want to collect data during the lunch hours, in some weeks class time will be replaced with data collection time. We need to be judicious about how long we spend in the market, so making plans will be important. How data is collected is important in many analytics situations; you may only get a few times to collect data. Make sure to make the most of it. There are many simulation software packages that can handle the simulations once we’re ready for that step.
